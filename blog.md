## 2021-09-23: Wiki's 1st anniversary!

> If you are looking for news about 1st anniversary celebration for the actual game, this is not it

Exactly one year ago, I laid out the ground work for this fan wiki (see [commit](https://github.com/liveahero-wiki/liveahero-wiki.github.io/commit/7afbf575428a8b9af2603c251c88f04e2b3c9ace)).
I wanted a wiki that is built on top of automation so that we can get accurate skill descriptions ASAP, and I didn't want to have ads
like those fandom wikis. There are some technical decisions that I regret now, such as hosting it on Github Pages instead of Netlify (the former
lacks proper support of page redirection, more sensible caching, or unlimited website size), but at least the whole thing doesn't cost me a single cent.

Making this wiki like an open source project on Github has made it harder to get wiki contributors as the usual contribution
workflow is very different. Despite that, we have enough volunteers to help translate skill names, voice lines, sales reports and special quests as well as
writing gameplay guides. Huge thank you to all their work so that we the japanese-illiterate people can play this game.

I had wanted to make an art to celebrate this, but the thought of having to draw everyone from [Parallel Flight](/affiliations/#parallel-flight) to be "fair" is 
too daunting that I never started. (You can still find my other arts at [@rongjie_mini](https://twitter.com/rongjie_mini) (NSFW warning)).

But still we can have some fun here. I created a survey to collect some interesting statistics from the community. The survey
will close after awhile, then I will find some time to comb through the data and publish the result here.

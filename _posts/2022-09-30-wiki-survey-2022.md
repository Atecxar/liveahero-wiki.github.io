Thank you for those who have participated! We received 229 responses, which is slightly lower than previous year.

Many of the questions were from last year survey, so preparation and analysis are much faster this time. I tried to present the data in a more meaningful way after learning from last year's experience.

Before we start, be reminded that the data is by no means representative to the entire LAH playerbase, as mostly only English players who use this wiki have contributed to the survey.

## Gender

<figure>

</figure>

93.01% of the respondents identify as male, 0.44% (i.e. 1 person) as female and the rest as "non-binary". I hope the only female respondent of this *lGbt* game has not been traumatised by the fandom yet.

## Age

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/survey-2022/age.png" width="608" height="534" loading="lazy" alt="Age pie chart">
</figure>

In terms of age, we can see that majority of the respondents are in their 20s. We have two persons above 40 years old while we got none from last year.

I forgot to mark thiss question as mandatory, so there 3 people that did not fill this up.

## Japanesse Proficiency

More than 68% of the respondents have some degree of Japanese understanding, with 15.3% of them having studied Japanese at various N* level. 1 respondentis native speaker!

</figure>

8.7% of the respondents don't actually play the game, which has increased from last year (2.4%). Close to 90% of the people have played "Tokyo Afterschool Summoners", another (older) gacha game developed by LifeWonders.

## Translation

<figure>

</figure>

Once again, the majority of us gave the correct prediction, but how we wish we were wrong...

The percentage of respondents believing that we will get official translation is higher than last year (from 30.2%).

## Money Spending

</figure>

46.67% of the respondents spend some money in this game, with 25-29 age group spending the most.

Caveat:

- Characters with zero vote are not included in the plot
- Characters added after 2nd anniversary are not included

> tl;dr: Y'all are furries
>
> (just kidding)

Barrel, Ryekie, Monomasa and Pubraseer take the top spots as expected, their wiki pages were also some of the most visited pages when there were no active game event happening (what are these people even doing with their time).

Akashi is the most popular non-furry character, dude really can have more confidence in himself.

The "top 6" ranking shows roughly the same trend as "top 3" ranking with added benefit of shining some light on characters that do have lesser fan supports. Therefore, I plan to make "unlimited" ranking and "top X" ranking next year (with X being a much higher number).

There is another character popularity poll ran by a LAH Discord moderator on Twitter (with unlimited votes), the order of popularity is pretty consistent with what we have here, but Barrel received way more votes in Wiki survey. Go check it out! [twitter link](https://twitter.com/HopperTheFace/status/1576040323503255553).

## Character Popularity (Reason)

</figure>

Unsurprisingly, character appearance is the biggest factor as to why a person stan the character. There are no collaration between age/gender of the respondent vs the factor of liking a character.

I will remove these questions next year as they don't really offer much value.

## Feedback for the Survey and Wiki

Sincere thanks for all the positive feedbacks from you guys.

There are also suggestions and criticisms, I will try to answers the more common ones here.

Notes:

- "Wiki channel" refers to `#lah-wiki` in LAH Discord

### 6 favourite characters are not enough!

Your voice is heard loud and clear. We will have "unlimited" favourite ranking next year.

### Why can't I choose If-XXX character in the ranking

Something I have been going back and forth for a long time. If we are getting more of such character in the future, I might add them.

### More questions in the survey

We received some question suggestions like "event poll" and "gacha pulling behaviours". We will try to include them if can we figure out how to phrase them as survey quesstion next year

### Have a better mobile UX for mouse-over related Wiki feature like showing statuss description

This is something we know that needs improvement, but don't have a concrete idea as to how it should look like. If you have an example from another website, a mock UI or even a proof-of-concept implementation, please let us know!

### Make skill description easier to understand

Totally agree, this is one of the downside of auto generatinsg desription based on game data. At the very least, we can add a section to clarify the skill mechanism that are more complicated.

### Suggestion on how to use a hero/sidekick, pairing, strategy etc

It is my wish to keep this Wiki more or less impartial about game strategy, because game meta can change with time and the worth of a game unit often depends on situation and the player's style.

However, I do wish to keep a list of such resources in the homepage so that those who need them know where to find, and their content creators won't be restricted by this Wiki. Do post suggestions in Wiki channel so that we can list them in the homepage!

### Catalogues of game backgrounds and audio files

This Wiki is currently hosted on Github Pages (free) with max 1GB storage space, and we are already on track to reach the limit in less than 2 years. We can't afford to add more files to eat into the storage space.

### Translation for XXX character's voice line(s)

These requests are usually for voice lines that do not have in-game text (e.g. battle voices or max Lv voice). This will rely on our translators actually owning the unit to hear the voices themselves. If there are transcripts on JP Wiki, you can try requesting a translation on wiki channel.

### Why you make character sprite so hard to be shared

Character sprites are actually generated in your web browser with a combined texture file, becausse storing each character sprite separately will use twice the storage space (and we only have 1GB in total).

(For apps/websites that support this, such as Discord and most Google apps) You can right-click/long-press the character sprite and choose "Copy image") (not "Copy image as address"), then directly paste the image into the textbox of your messaging app to share it.

Well, that's all for the survey result. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. This Wiki will be here to carry the game for English players for at least one more year.

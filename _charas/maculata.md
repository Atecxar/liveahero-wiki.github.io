An alien woman who has an office in Orient City and is active as a fashion designer.

Self-proclaimed "carnivorous woman",  with a bullish and courageous personality, there
is always a spirit of not letting anyone else take charge.

Taking advantage of her natural beauty and blessed body, she can be a model that stands on the runway herself.

Because of her strict attitude toward herself and others, she has a slight temper.

Although she is a master to Sui, the sense of distance from her best friend's daughter is a little delicate because of the circumstances.

A surgeon working at a general hospital in an immigrant city on the moon.

An Asian Lunarian whose full name is Rakta Salya.

As a doctor, he is an exceedingly serious person. Even though a fixed amount of trust in his abilities, his enthusiasm tends to run at idle because he is serious in everything he does.

After being taught by a senior doctor that "Being a surgeon is a trial of strength", he has undergone various health methods and attend the gym 5 times a week, which is an aspect of a health nut who spares no effort even when misguided.

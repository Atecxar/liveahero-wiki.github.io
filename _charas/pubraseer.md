A sailor handyman who is in charge of clean-up at a spaceship resort. 

He is a beastman alien with a cheerful and carefree personality. 

During the spaceship resort's construction, he protected the nearby sea area. 

He lost his memories pertaining to his time protecting it, and even conversations about it are difficult for him, 
but because he has a lot more curiosity than others, he has managed to absorb how to speak, as well as knowledge. 

Sometimes, he hears impossible to understand words from the pendant he was found with, which always give him a headache.

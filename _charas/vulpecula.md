Vulpecula, a phantom thief known for stealing valuable cultural artifacts and destroying cultural heritage sites he cannot steal.

He describes these acts as "stealing the landscape," and before the crime, a mysterious and poetic notice video is always distributed on illegal sites.

Some people sympathize with his ideals and he has attained a level of cult popularity, and enthusiastic fans often become his subordinate villains.

He always wears a fox mask and no one knows his true face, but because of that many copycats have used his likeness against his ideals.

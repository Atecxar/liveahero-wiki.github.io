A diver who loves the lake in his hometown who grew up to work as a guide instructor for the tourists that visit.

However, he despises those who pollute the lake and has left a rather scary impression on others due to his wariness which has made him have a very intense attitude, making it so he is very rarely called upon by others.

He adores the silence in the water, spends a lot of life diving and has the most knowledge out of anyone of it when it comes to diving. 

He has a tattoo-esque pattern on his body, and often wears a wetsuit to hide it all.

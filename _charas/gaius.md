Gaius uses a glove-shaped parallel weapon to generate an ethereal bow and arrows, and can adjust the size of the energy projectiles he releases as arrows according to ViewPower, the number of arrows he loads, and the speed at which he fires them, allowing him to attack from a distance without losing power.

The Hero Suit is also specialized for underwater activities, with a ring on the back and a tail fin-like module to control the water flow, allowing the hero to shift into attack position without losing his balance in any position.

The elderly couple who raised Gaius passed away when he was a teenager, and through a letter they left him, he learned that he was not their son by blood.

Secretly alienated from others, Gaius chose to live on his own rather than rely on others, and set his sights on solving the mystery of his birth. 

Gaius gazed at the still surface of the water and asked himself, "Who am I? Believing that the answer is somewhere in the lake, he dives back into the water.

A diver who loves the lake in his hometown who grew up to work as a guide instructor for the tourists that visit.

However, he despises those who pollute the lake and has left a rather scary impression on others due to his wariness which has made him have a very intense attitude, making it so he is very rarely called upon by others.

He adores the silence in the water, spends a lot of life diving and has the most knowledge out of anyone of it when it comes to diving. 

He has a tattoo-esque pattern on his body, and often wears a wetsuit to hide it all.

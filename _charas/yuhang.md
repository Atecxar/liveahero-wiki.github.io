    Yuhang's parallel weapon is a chinese kitchen knife as tall as himself, very similar to his favorite knife.
  
    Not only does it cut object, but with a solid enough pass it can also cut space, creating a path that leads to the "kitchen", which is detached from the time axis.
  
    In the "kitchen", the energy stored from his attacks can be used as "ingredients" to make various dishes,
    instantly awakening the vitality of the body and mind of those who eat them.
  
    Since entering and leaving the kitchen and cooking require physical and mental strength, the drawback is that too much usage can lead to fatigue.

    Yuhang was an orphan as a result of a kaibutsu disaster, he once lived in a refugee camp.
  
    At that time, he could not forget the taste of the delicious food of happiness prepared by a person who came for emergency food distribution, 
    and the sight of the people who shared it with him, their faces filled with joy and happiness, so he decided to become a chef.
  
    He was adopted by the owner of a restaurant and trained as a chef, and now that he is a well-known chef, 
    he continues to wander throughout the universe in search of a cooking that can rival the taste of happiness.

    Foolishly optimistic, with a penchant of suddenly wandering around, carefree in behaviour.
  
    When it comes to cooking, however, Yuhang shows a serious and delicate skill that is hard to imagine from his usual appearance,
    and the restaurants that Yuhang has helped out at are reluctant to let him go.
  
    He is very inquisitive about food and will eat anything to try it out,
    which has sent him to the hospital many times under the care of M.A.H.A. doctors.

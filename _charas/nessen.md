A man who manages both a hot spring resort in the southern part of Orient City and one of the hot spring inns located there. Born in Shizuoka, Japan, his full name is Mochizuki Nessen. He is half earthling, half alien. 
He has a stern expression on his face, his body is rugged and he has 2 sharp horns, due to which people are oftentimes scared of him when they meet for the first time. He is a gentle person with a soft demeanor, but he has a strong sense of responsibility. He loves taking baths and does so about 5 times a day.

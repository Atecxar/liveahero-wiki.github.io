{% capture BIO_H01 %}
Drovain, the kaibutsu that nests inside Monomasa's body envelops the outside of his body in this form, transforming him into the villain "Monstrooper".  

Being an amorphous creature, Drovain wraps around Monomasa's body, becoming both an armor to protect his body and a weapon to enhance his physical abilities. 

With its elasticity, he is able to battle his fellow Kaibutsu by using inhuman tactics and combat techniques, and rescue their eaten victims.

Born into an elite family, Monomasa was a puppet-like young man who lived a life that reflected almost none of his own will. 

One day, he met a dying Kaibutsu with consciousness, capable of speech and has no desire to eat others. 

Tired of life and wandering around looking for a place to commit suicide, Monomasa made a proposition to the dying Kaibutsu. 

And after some questions and answers that satisfied him, he surrendered his body to the Kaibutsu and gave up on his own future.

Drovain's wish is for Monomasa to come out in the open again and be able to live by his own will.

{% capture BIO_S01 %}
A rare sight to behold where a kaibutsu has willingly taken over the body of a therian alien.

The name of the therian is Oosato Monomasa and the name of the kaibutsu is Drovain. 

Monomasa's soul is always in a deep sleep, and so the outward personality is always Drovain's. 

They are unique in the fact that they have a personality, because Kaibutsu are supposed to be an empty vessel. 

They are considered to be a peculiar being, because they are "villains of justice", always respecting the lives of the masses.  

Monomasa is a very quiet and timid young man while Drovain's personality is cool and collected.

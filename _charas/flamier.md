With a lab coat flapping like a cape, she transforms into a hero who fights using all kinds of equipment to synthesize and burn chemicals.

However, since her goal is not \[to kill or injure her enemies with explosions\], but \[to make beautiful flames for everyone to see\], her techniques are not as destructive as they are flashy.

Nevertheless, she is a fearsome hero since her goal also means to make the surroundings a \[Sea of Fire\], literally.

Her wish is to \[Make the most beautiful fireworks in the universe blooms at the most beautiful place\].

Combustion can only occur where there is an atmosphere, and on some planets, the reaction does not occur as expected due to the components that make up the atmosphere.

There are many substances that do not even burn in the first place.

That's why to pursue her astounding ideals, she dedicate herself to the research of combustible substances everyday.

Her unusual obsession with fire is probably second to none.

Subaru is a novelist who lives and works in Orient city. He is an earthling from Japan who comes from Hamamatsu, with his full name and pen name being Nobeyama Subaru. With a slightly old-fashioned writing style and incredibly overwhelming story composition, he has managed to gather a certain fan base. His literary works consist a lot of humanity, but in actuality, he acts like an old man who is an unfriendly, jerky and sarcastic cynic. 

He tends to dislike unnecessary outings and situations where he is disturbed by others, because it throws his life into disorder, which is why he also tends to withdraw from things. Within the same city's primary school, he works as a licensed teacher, though he has a bit of an undesirable (yet inseparable) relationship with it since childhood.

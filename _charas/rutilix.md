A knight apprentice who is part of the cavalry belonging to a kingdom from another world, named Aradisia. 

He intends to become a fine knight, and he has a great deal of enthusiasm, but he has a short temper and is impatient. 

His sword skill is named Henachoco and it has many drawbacks. He is the youngest child of a low-class family, and therefore he gets neglected often in the squad he is in. On top of that, he is impatient because he is not able to amass any achievements. 

Even so, he is quite liked by King Alphecca due to his dedication to his knight training.  Because he and Akashi have such similar personalities, they tend to often get into arguments. 

After accepting King Alphecca's invitation, he went out on a journey into a labyrinth that is rumored to be difficult to escape.

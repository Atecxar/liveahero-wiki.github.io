A young leader of a long-established circus troupe based in Orient City.

His full name is Yatomi Yasuhiko.

He left his Japanese father, who was busy running the circus, and lived in Moscow with his Russian mother.

He has seen many circus performances from his early childhood, and with his father being a circus ringmaster as well, he has a deep knowledge of the circus, and at the same time was also quite involved in it.

He is a young man who is cheerful, determined, and most of all loves to entertain, but his feud with his father and the dilemma of not being able to run the circus as he wishes cast a dark shadow on his mind.

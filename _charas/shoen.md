{% capture BIO_H01 %}
Transforms into a hakama-clad hero who carries a parallel weapon in the shape of a huge brush. Using his tail as an inkwell, the energy extracted from his body can be used as ink to form an embodied "living kanji character" in the air. The letters he writes act according to the meaning of the word, and when they finish their actions, they disperse. Shoen's technique has a particular characteristic that the power of the attack and the effect on the target can change according to different meanings of the characters.

His hope is to "write 'living' characters." Every time he sees the letters written in the air gaining life and fulfilling their assigned mission, he becomes keenly aware of his imperfection and regrets it. All of this stems from a supreme book full of incredible writing that he once laid eyes on in a Japanese temple. In the ink marks, he saw a beauty that would never decay no matter how much time passed. He continues to challenge himself with calligraphy, until the day when he can produce such a work with his own hands.

Shoen stood up during the calamity in which everyone's secrets are revealed regardless of their intention/desire.

Whilst wearing a mantle that hides his body, it resembles an outfit befitting of someone on a mission to infiltrate an enemy organisation, personifying the thought that "There are things that's better if kept hidden".

In his hand, he has a brush that is disguised as an umbrella.

In the event of an emergency in enemy territory, he pulls out his brush and uses the ink in his suitcase to protect people's secrets.

Modesty is a virtue, for a poor talker and cowardly person like him,

What he fears most is that others will find out about his greedy side.

The root of this is a bitter memory of falling in love with those he work for.

Understanding his position and being confused with his gushing feelings, he hold the trauma of saying the last farewell without conveying his feelings.

His desire and his cowardice ashamed him greatly, and so he lock this memory deep down in his heart.

Telling himself to never expose it again…or so it should be.

An alien youth with a wolf-like appearance, one of the species that more commonly migrates to Earth.
They are often seen as a species of rough people because all the young people who are enthusiastic and rowdy are the most likely to wander from their homeworld, but like Earthlings, each individual has different personalities, tastes, and dreams. Looking only at those who are active as villains, there are of course some who are proud of being villains and others who have a faint admiration for heroes.

reXer is a pro gamer with an unknown age belonging to the Neotalents Production's pro gamer team "Î¼-Hyperions".

Besides just working as a professional gamer, he also works as a cyber hero TV personality in the virtual space.

He is top ranked in every gaming field in terms of skill, and while he does give off the vibe of a mature man who possesses a calm way of speaking, he is very childish on the inside. 

He used to work as a hero in the real world, but nowadays he seems to have disappeared.

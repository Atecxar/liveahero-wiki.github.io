Transforming into a hero with a bright colored visor and armor, his parallel weapon is a huge sword that can also transform into a battle axe.

His fighting style, in which he transforms freely according to the battle situation and the opponent to then rounds up all his enemies, is exactly like that of a hunter who stands up against a huge monster in a video game world.

However, at some point, there has been a change in his fighting style, and fans are concerned about what happened.

reXer is a pro gamer with an unknown age belonging to the Neotalents Production's pro gamer team "Î¼-Hyperions".

Besides just working as a professional gamer, he also works as a cyber hero TV personality in the virtual space.

He is top ranked in every gaming field in terms of skill, and while he does give off the vibe of a mature man who possesses a calm way of speaking, he is very childish on the inside. 

He used to work as a hero in the real world, but nowadays he seems to have disappeared.

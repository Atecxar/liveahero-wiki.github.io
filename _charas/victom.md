Victom transforms into "Survive taker" when he dresses up in a suit and armor closely resembling that of a rescue squad uniform. He possesses a rope which allows him to reach his rescue target in the shortest distance possible even if they are in the belly of a kaibutsu.  He makes the best use of his suit and rope which have the ability to break through any obstacle; that allows him to carry out rescue missions at the speed of sound.

His desire/wish is "to have the power to rescue all the weak and powerless people who are threatened." It it something that he swore to do after he saw his entire family that disappeared (died) in a city that was once attacked and burned by a ravenous/aggressive kaibutsu. Despite having numerous injuries to his face under the helmet he wears, the reason he continues to do his best to help others is out of a desire for revenge against kaibutsu.

The commanding officer of Orient City Fire Department's Hyper Rescue team, always wearing a full face helmet.

Originating from London, England. His full name is Victom Vincent.

Calm and stoic, he is a man who is as much of a life saver as possible, possessing an oustanding situational awareness ability.

Even though he believes that all lives are precious, there is a side of him that follows the saying of "To Live for others, and to die for others", so he tends to look down on his life.

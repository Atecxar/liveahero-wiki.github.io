He is transformed into "The Commander", a military hero with a fan and a shogi board that can be used as weapons. He is a rare type of hero who is better at fighting strategically and leading others than fighting individually, and can perform various simulations using the shogi board that can display both allies and enemies. As he moves his pieces on the board, he collaborates with the operators to plan strategies and inspires his allies with his military fan, which can inflame the morale of the troops, to lead the team to victory

In his mind, he was constantly torn between the frustration of not being able to go out into the field as he was usually in the command center giving orders, and the fear that he would be a burden to the heroes on his side by joining the ranks after being out of the field for so long. Although he may seem frivolous, he has a strong sense of responsibility, and he chooses to take a step back, biting back the frustration. When he stands on the battlefield, how the battle situation will move...even he himself does not know.

An earthling from Osaka, Japan, his full name is Takadono Okitaka.
With his cheerful and sociable personality and affable manner, he doesn't come across like a person in a key internal management position, but his wisdom as a commander is outstanding.
The tight-knit working relationship between UEHA and Parallel Flight is due to the fact that he, Ryekie and Huckle formed a deep bond after a joint battle.

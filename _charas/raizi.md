  BIO_S01: |-
    A hero operator belonging to Independent Heroes.
    
    He is very intuitive and smart. Therefore, he use gambling as his main daily income.
    
    As an observer who perceives in multiple sense, 
    Raizi explains that it's this sensation that pulls him along, enables him to open a pass with parallel universe.
    
    Usually he acts with utmost concentration and calm, 
    but when encountering a supernatural things like ghost or spirit he will exhibit an extreme fear.
    
    This is because of something he experience in his early childhood, it had cast a deep shadow in him since.
    
    
    Since birth, Raizi has exhibited very high observational ability, 
    and such he grew up with harsh circumstances from childhood.
    
    His bluffing personality is perhaps a result of his adaptation towards this circumstances, 
    as he probably realized that it's necessary to survive.
    
    On the other hand, he's not good with older men, 
    perhaps it's because he has a history of being taken advantage of by a man who discovered his talents in gambling.
    
    He is sometimes in a daze and is said to be looking at other parallel universes, 
    but he does not want to talk much about what he has observed, so the truth is not known for certain.

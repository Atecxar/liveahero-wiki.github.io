Sadayoshi transforms into military uniformed hero, with massive parallel weapons on his arms and legs. 

Through rigorous education and intense training, he has acquired much higher physical skills than the other soldiers, and through the parallel weapons in his hands and feet, he can unleash punches and kicks strengthened hundreds to thousands of times. 

Normally, he saves the release of his power according to the surrounding environment, but when he fires his fist at maximum power, an earthquake with violent earth cracks is said to occur all around him.

{% capture BIO_H02 %}
Sadayoshi has been raised to believe that his body should be used to protect the people, and he has become a hero to faithfully carry out that duty, to protect the people with all his body. 

Some people call him a toadie or a lapdog, but he cares little about the jeers of others. 

Of course, he has desires and emotions that he keeps hidden from the public. 

What he doesn't know is that when he unleashes the desires he has locked away, he will become a stronger and more resilient hero than ever before.

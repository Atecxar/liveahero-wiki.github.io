They all share the belief that if there's money involved, the job will be done no matter what, but they also understand that technology is of utmost importance for the trust of their employers.

They are able to hide with the active camouflage their mantles provide, and shoot from very long distances with their parallel weapon - the laser rifle. 

As for those that manage to get close - they have a knife on the tip of their tail that they can cut their enemies with.

They all seem to have belonged to a military organization of sorts, albeit all believing that they don't need to talk about the past. 

They've survived a vast number of battles, and while some are more strategic while others are more warlike in personality, they all share one thing in common, which is that during a battle, they will always be thoroughly prepared. 

They are aware that even small information leaks, as well as small mistakes can mean certain death. 

For that reason, they have an unspoken agreement that showing their true face to someone is a sign of trust.

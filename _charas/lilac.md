Lilac's pruning shears-shaped parallel weapon can be manipulated without being touched by his will alone, and he attacks by sending them flying after opponents. 

The size and number of shears can be adjusted according to the ViewPower consumed, but it takes a considerable amount of physical and mental strength to manipulate several of them at the same time. 

However, the sharpness of the shears is outstanding, and as long as the object is perceived by Lilac as a branch or leaf, it can cut off both sides of any object, no matter how hard it is.

Lilac's older brother, Hashidoi was born sickly from birth, with particularly poor eyesight and a fondness for flowers and other fragrant things. 

Contrary to his brother, Lilac as a child was active and dynamic, but when Hashidoi became ill and was unable to play with him for days at a time, he would lash out in childish anger and say things he didn't mean. 

Although he felt deep remorse even as a child, Lilac permanently lost the opportunity to apologize for it one day, and came to be grounded in the idea that what one wants to say should be said right away rather than put off.

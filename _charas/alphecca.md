However, due to the nature of his curious and free spirit, he oftentimes worries about the people close to him. 

Originally, because the second son doesn't inherit the throne, he trains to become a knight.

It seems to have something to do with "The white knight" who appears on the battlefield gallantly and gets remarkable results.

He invites the Rutilix, who has trouble achieving anything, to an exploration into a labyrinth which has quickly caused some turmoil.

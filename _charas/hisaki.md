A young man working at a medium sized factory of a heavy industry equipment manufacturer.

He looks like a beast-human alien, but because he was adopted by a Japanese family, his full name is Yodobashi Hisaki.

He has a wide range of knowledge about science and engineering, and is a genius inventor as recognized by himself and his peers alike.

He is usually devoted to developing suspicious "new products" in his personal laboratory in a secluded corner of the factory.

He is a self-confident person with a sociable and cheerful personality, but at the same time he is quite sloppy.

He calls his college senior Crowne his big sis, and both trusts and lives in fear of her at the same time.

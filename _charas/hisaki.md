He dreams of grasping a glorious future with his hand, and his parallel weapon is an equipment that can reproduce \[The Future\] in his hands.

By accessing the brain of his future self, which has succeeded in reaching the cutting edge of the entire universe, 

he can output things on his glove that cannot be created with modern technology and can be used as a weapon.

These weapons, made up of unknown technology that can only be described as the product of magic, foreshadow the infinite development of science and technology.

He is proud of himself as a genius and acts confidently, asserting straightforwardly his desires for self-expression and approval, desires that are often perceived in a negative light.

This personality was shaped by his defiance against the people around him who kept pointing at him as a \[fake\] and his desire to make them recognize his existence.

Wishing to assert his existence and be recognized by as many people as possible .....he continues to search for the development of cutting-edge technology that will surprise everyone.

A young man working at a medium sized factory of a heavy industry equipment manufacturer.

He looks like a beast-human alien, but because he was adopted by a Japanese family, his full name is Yodobashi Hisaki.

He has a wide range of knowledge about science and engineering, and is a genius inventor as recognized by himself and his peers alike.

He is usually devoted to developing suspicious "new products" in his personal laboratory in a secluded corner of the factory.

He is a self-confident person with a sociable and cheerful personality, but at the same time he is quite sloppy.

He calls his college senior Crowne his big sis, and both trusts and lives in fear of her at the same time.

Shaft has escaped from the drudgery of daily life with a new ideal of delivering important people to their destination.

He realized that it was important to pave the way to the future with confidence, not cling feebly to the past, and he grasped the steering wheel praying he would not be too late.

A former professional rugby player, he is now an Earthling who drives a space cab.

When he was a rugby player, his motto was to be a player who could carry the ball to the goal without falling down, and he was called "Iron Man" because of his style of trying to take as many steps forward as possible even after being tackled.

With a gentle and honest disposition, he has low self-esteem due to his clumsiness, whenever he makes a blunder he always reflect that he needs "to pull himself together".

For him, his left arm is a memento of a "friend" he once went through together but had disappeared. It's also a testament to his vow to "be the best pirate in the universe". No matter how many times he was arrested, he always escaped from prison. No matter how he was marked, he would stand at the front of his group and laugh boldly at the scene, but behind his unconventional way of life, He keeps striving to fulfill the promise he once made to his "friend", he is very sincere when it comes to friendships.

Sailing across the seven star systems, he is the leader of the space pirates, whose trademark is his artificial left arm. He is a chivalrous thief who steals money and goods from corrupt millionaires and rulers in order to give to the poor. Although not very intelligent, he is a man among men who possesses a big hearted personality capable of charming just about anybody. He is a hedonist who values the concept of "interesting" above all things, and deals only with targets and heroes that he deems as such. Despite not being registered as a hero and being classified as a villain capable of transforming, if there is an "interesting" mission on the table, he reaches out to Hero offices every now and then.

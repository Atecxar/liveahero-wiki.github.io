The first time Kyoichi confronted Kaibutsu was at an elementary school he visited for TA training. His natural older brother instinct and his desire to protect younger children gave him the determination to "protect the world for his students," and gave birth to the hero "Element Teacher." On the battlefield, he wields weapons resembling the balls, vaulting boxes, and set squares that he handles in elementary school classes, and shows students "why evil doesn't pay".

His identity as  "Element Teacher" is kept secret from his students, as a special consideration to not endanger the children close to him, and because he does not want to show off his achievements. Even so, he watches with a fond smile as his students play "Element Teacher" at recess.

Kyoichi describes himself in this new form as "Agent of Love, E.T.L.".

Transformed into this figure, he is a warrior of love on a mission to rescue children in the midst of terrorism.

Because they perceive romance as embarrassing, the children mutually deride one another in a negative feedback loop and create their own hell full of anger and sadness, with all their secrets exposed. 

As a mature adult, he rescues children and runs through enemy strongholds in a black suit, using chalk bullets as a weapon.

Modesty is a virtue, and he is very afraid of being a timid person and a poor talker.

This intense desire of his is to be known by others.

The root of this is a bitter memory of falling in love with those he work for.

Understanding his position and being confused with his gushing feelings, he hold the trauma of saying the last farewell without conveying his feelings.

His desire and his timidity ashamed him greatly, and so he lock this memory deep down in his heart.

Telling himself to never expose it again…or so it should be.

By the way, it seems like "Elementary students are the base he's supposed to defend".

A swimmer employed by the sporting goods company Phalanx.
Long ago on the ocean planet Muilauka IV, he rampaged as a fearsome pirate villain, but after being captured and rehabilitated by heroes, he has become a pro swimmer and hero.
As a former pirate, he has a bad temper and a lot of blood on his hands, but because he was a pirate, he has a strong sense of camaraderie and is very caring towards his allies.
He is very susceptible to both flattery and provocation, so he can be easily manipulated at times.

    The paper talisman parallel weapon that he can summon, called shikifuda, transforms into various shikigami at his will and acts like a living creature. 
    It's a high performance power but with very bad fuel efficiency, 
    to compensate it subtitutes part of required viewpower energy with the power of yin-yang path of the flow of dragon veins.

    or sometimes appear to fight together with the heroes, only to leave right after.

    Self-proclaimed local actor, born in Shinraku, a city in Kyoto created by alien immigrants.
    He likes to be involved with others and is a reasonably well-known face in his hometown.
    On the other hand, few people know about his personal life, and he himself is reluctant to talk about his private life.
    Since a certain incident, a way of speaking that avoid his true feelings has been deeply ingrained in him, 
    making it hard for him to actually convey himself to other people at crucial times.

{% capture BIO_S01 %}
A truck driver for an interplanetary freight forwarding company.
He looks like an adult earthling male, but is actually an android from the machine lifeform star Tronesion.
Manufactured for espionage during the outbreak of the war between organic and mechanical lifeforms.
Although he is a machine, he has a feeling of compassion and envy for organic life forms, and is conducting research every day, hoping to get closer to a living human being.
The mental age is a little young and pure hearted contrary to the impression his appearance gives off.

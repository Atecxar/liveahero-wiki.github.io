{% capture BIO_H01 %}
His desire to be a living human is most strongly expressed in his appearance when he transforms into a hero. 

When it comes to mechanical life forms, they have various advantages to them like high defense and their bodies are adorned with interchangeable heavy armaments, 
but organic lifeforms have the advantage of being able to construct flexible and complex thoughts.

Although it is a temporary one, his body as a hero, consists of flesh and blood, is literally full of life.

{% capture BIO_H02 %}
He was created during a period of war to collect information regarding organic lifeforms,
but as he lived blending with other organic lifeforms, he came to be attached and envious of them.

He was fascinated by them because they have flesh and blood unlike himself.

Then the war ended, he was disposed at the outer space and somehow drifted to a place where people toil.

Until the day he become the same as them, he will continue fighting to protect the warmth of people.

{% capture BIO_S01 %}
A truck driver for an interplanetary freight forwarding company.

He looks like an adult earthling male, but is actually an android from the machine lifeform star Tronesion.

Manufactured for espionage during the outbreak of the war between organic and mechanical lifeforms.

Although he is a machine, he has a feeling of compassion and envy for organic life forms, and is conducting research every day, hoping to get closer to a living human being.

The mental age is a little young and pure hearted contrary to the impression his appearance gives off.

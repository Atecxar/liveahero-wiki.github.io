When he was a soldier, he was feared by his enemies and revered by his allies.

This was a time when Yoshiori's existence was most recognized by others.

He wants to "reclaim his existence," and as such he transforms into a villain clad in armaments that reflects his memories of that time. 
He has regained his right arm and abdomen, which were digested by Kaibutsu, 

and from his abdomen, which is connected to another space, he can take out various weapons that he has handled before. 

His favorite weapon seems to be a machine gun.

One day on the battlefield, Yoshiori was eaten by Kaibutsu and was freed in a partially digested state, turning him into "a person who never existed".

He disappeared from the memories of his parents, siblings, and friends, and from his family register and records. 

Normal people can't see him, touch him, or hear his voice.

In his desperate loneliness, Yoshiori vows to reclaim his existence by any means necessary. 

Today, he fights to have his existence recognized by the people he loves again.

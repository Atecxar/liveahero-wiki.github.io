His camera-type parallel weapon can literally "freeze a moment", and when the shutter is released, the target in the frame stops moving for a certain period of time. 

The duration is as short as a few seconds and it is not stable, but when the path to the parallel world is opened to the maximum, it is possible to stop for a longer time and a wider range than before. 

"5 seconds... more than enough."  

In that short time, he attacks his enemies with high physical ability that belies his petite body.

Born in a city in the midst of a civil war, Kalaski has managed to survive while being separated from his family in the conflict. 

With nearly 30 years of life experience, he has traveled through numerous conflict zones, sneaking through sometimes life-threatening situations and taking photographs.  
He considers it his mission to capture every moment of life's life, which is born and disappears like bubbles on the battlefield, and keep it as a semi-permanent record.

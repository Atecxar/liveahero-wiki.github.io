His camera-type parallel weapon can literally "freeze a moment", and when the shutter is released, the target in the frame stops moving for a certain period of time. 

The duration is as short as a few seconds and it is not stable, but when the path to the parallel world is opened to the maximum, it is possible to stop for a longer time and a wider range than before. 

"5 seconds... more than enough."  

In that short time, he attacks his enemies with high physical ability that belies his petite body.

A conductor who conducts and performs using flying instrument drones.

He was born on a small, frigid planet with a small population, but it was lost due to a meteorite impact.

He used to be a hero, but since his planet's destruction, he has dropped all contact with his hero office and uses his power only for himself.

The concerts held in the theater spaceship he owns are watched all over the galaxy and boast a tremendous audience rating every time. 

Only a handful of supporters and favored guests are invited to personally attend the theatre spacecraft live.

{% capture BIO_H01 %}
The parallel weapon, in the form of a conductor's baton, specializes in collecting View Power, and when he raises his right hand, the eyes of ordinary observers are riveted.

It commands various instrumental drones and provides support and assistance in battle through the tones it plays.

The Parallel Weapon's enhanced abilities work against Borealis' natural ability to "hear the sounds of others," and in turn allow him to propagate and activate emotions and energy into the minds of others.

He also use this ability during his own concerts to mesmerize the audience.

Borealis has the innate ability to "hear" the inner sounds of others.

Listening to other people's emotions and thoughts unconsciously was very mentally taxing for Borealis himself, but he was supported by his close friends and family.

To reach them who have disappeared, Borealis persisted to collect a lot of Views.

As Borealis resonates with the sounds of others, he puts his own and others' thoughts into the sounds and makes them resonate in the hearts of the listeners. 

Hoping that one day it may reach them.

A conductor who conducts and performs using flying instrument drones.

He was born on a small, frigid planet with a small population, but it was lost due to a meteorite impact.

The concerts held in the theater spaceship he owns are watched all over the galaxy and boast a tremendous audience rating every time. 

Only a handful of supporters and favored guests are invited to personally attend the theatre spacecraft live.

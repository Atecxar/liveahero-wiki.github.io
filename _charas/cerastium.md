She is a riot policeman belonging to the Mobile Gendarmerie of the French National Gendarmerie, and also a member of the French branch of the UEHA. 

She is an earthling from Leon, France, but because she is half-alien, she has horns on her head. 

She had the intention of joining the mobile military force since she was a child, and really did manage to enlist. 

She has a very earnest and honest personality. She really loves the word "justice" and does not tolerate social injustice. 

She is an overzealous fan of Zap the Justice, respects greatly, almost the point of worship.

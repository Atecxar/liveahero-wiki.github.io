<h2>Story</h2>

<p>There's a theory that there are countless parallel universes outside of ours.</p>

<p>“If only I had acted like this back then…” “If only my dreams back then had come true...”</p>

<p>Within these countless parallel universe, there may exist a universe in which such “what if” scenarios is a reality…</p>

<p>The Earth of the future exists in one of these countless universes.</p>

<p>On this planet, a wide variety of earthlings and aliens roam the planet - humans, beast-human aliens, and mechanical life forms. And on that very planet, menaces from a dimension from outer space, Monsters, shows up and battles are waged night and day against them - and the only one who can oppose them are called heroes.</p>

<p>Businesspersons, police officers, teachers, carpenters, fisherfolks, freelancers, etc… People with various jobs will become heroes once these Monsters appear on their doorstep. With the help of “what-ifs” - the power of the universe of unlimited potential realities, these people are able to harness their power by embodying their dreams and steely resolute and fight against the looming threat in front of them.</p>

<p>And you, through a strange turn of events, have been hired to support these very heroes. You shall become the source and beacon to provide power to the heroes by helping them to live stream their battles, by observing the infinite "possibilities" hidden deep within the people around you…</p>

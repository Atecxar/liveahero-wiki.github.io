## About Challenge Simulator Quests

These high difficulty quests are much harder than any other content in the game. They don't consume any resource to start but only offer rewards based on the highest score you can reach.

Each challenge will consist of multiple waves. Any damage your heroes take during a wave will be carried over to the next wave. You can check the number of enemy waves before entering the battle. Some challenge will have bonus stats given to certain Heroes or Sidekicks.

Doing a challenge will grant you a score, the score will be calculated based on Quest Score Evaluation Criteria shown on the quest selection screen. You will get {% include item-icon.html id=68 %}Heronium depending on your score, which can be used as currency in the simulator exchange. You can exchange Heronium for {% include item-icon.html id=29 %} Legend Medal, {% include item-icon.html id=59 %} Parallel Quartz, and more.

Quest in simulator will reset after a period of time (normally within 14 days), after which the quest will be changed.  Any unused Heronium will be converted to 150 {% include item-icon.html id=35 %} each when the quest reset.

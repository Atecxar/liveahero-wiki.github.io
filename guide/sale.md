You can leave the hero for a set amount of time during the business. Sales reward currency needed to improve your characters: {% include item.html id=11 %}, {% include item.html id=35 %} (Laf), and {% include item.html id=30 %} (Training Bands). All sale types reward some EXP.

## Business Slot

There are four business slots. Initially, only two are unlocked. An additional slot is unlocked after beating Chapter 1 of the [Main Quest](/guide/quest/#main-quest), while the fourth slot is unlockable with a Business Slot Unlock Ticket purchasable from the [Shop](/guide/shop/) for 10 {% include item.html id=1 %}.

Heroes departed onto an ongoing business cannot be assigned onto a different business. However, they are free to participate in [Quests](/guide/quest/).

## Business Hour

Business can be conducted in set amounts of time: two hours, four hours, eight hours, and 16 hours. There is no difference in efficiency as the rewards scale linearly with the amount of time spent, so choose a timing that fits your lifestyle. Note that rewards are cumulative with business obtainable experience values.

## Business Bonus

The amount of currency obtained in each type of Sale is increased by a bonus. Heroes going on the business give a +5% bonus, up to maximum of +45% if all eight slots are filled; 5★ Heroes provide an additional +5%, up to a maximum of 45%. Hence, the maximum total of bonus for each sale is +90% for a team of eight 5★ Heroes. Obtainable experience is also affected by this bonus.

## Business Log

When a business has been completed you will receive a business log from the characters who have departed for the business.

## About Quest

You can read scenarios, and battle to obtain items.

## Quest Selection

On the quest selection menu, by either hold tapping on the quest banner, or by tapping on the magnifying glass icon, will display the information of enemies encountered, along with the items that can possibly be obtained.

## Main Quest

This is the quest where you can read the game's main story. Go to [Main Quests](/main_quests/) to a list of Main Quest chapters.

## Enhancement/ Training Quest

These quests are meant for gathering items that can be used to raise and rank up [Heroes](/guide/hero/) and [Sidekicks](/guide/sidekick/). Enhancement Quests are divided between Ticket Quests and Free Quests.

Free Quests' only requirement to start is a sufficient amount of stamina while Ticket Quests also require 1 {% include item-icon.html id=38 %}Quest Ticket each time. In exchange, Ticket Quests consume less stamina and give better rewards.

You can obtain 3 {% include item-icon.html id=38 %}Quest Tickets from login bonus everyday though the maximum number of tickets you can hold is also 3. Ticket Quests are depicted with orange color.

### EXP Quests and Bond Quests

EXP Quests and Bond Quests can be selected at any time. They each come in two ticket require ranks (Beginner & Expert) and five free ranks (D to S).

These quests award each Hero and Sidekick with large, fixed amount of EXP/Bond, so it is recommended to bring along as many Heroes and Sidekicks as possible. There is a spillover effect for max level Heroes and Sidekicks. As such, the EXP a max level Hero would have received is converted into {% include item-icon.html id=11 %}EXP Items, whereas Sidekick's Bond is converted into {% include item-icon.html id=30 %}Training Bands.

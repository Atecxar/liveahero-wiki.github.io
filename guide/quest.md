## About Quest

You can read scenarios, and battle to obtain items.

## Quest Selection

On the quest selection menu, by either hold tapping on the quest banner, or by tapping on the magnifying glass icon, will display the information of enemies encountered, along with the items that can possibly be obtained.

## Main Quest

This is the quest where you can read the game's main story. Go to [Main Quests](/main_quests/) to a list of Main Quest chapters.

## Enhancement/ Training Quest

These quests are meant for gathering items that can be used to raise and rank up [Heroes](/guide/hero/) and [Sidekicks](/guide/sidekick/). Enhancement Quests are divided by rank, with higher ranks offering better rewards at the cost of being more difficult and consuming higher levels of stamina.

### EXP Item Quests

EXP Item Quests can be selected at any time, and come in four ranks (D to A). These quests award each Hero and Sidekick with large, fixed amount of EXP, so it is recommended to bring along as many Heroes and Sidekicks as possible. There is a spillover effect for max level Heroes and Sidekicks. As such, the EXP a max level Hero would have received is converted into {% include item.html id=11 %}, whereas Sidekick EXP is converted into {% include item.html id=30 %}. In addition, EXP Item Quests drop {% include item.html id=11 %}, {% include item.html id=30 %}, and {% include item.html id=35 %}.

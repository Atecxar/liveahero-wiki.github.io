## About Battle

Pair a hero with a sidekick, and fight against monsters and other heroes. Winning the battle gives various rewards, depending on the type of [Quest](/guide/quest). All quests award [Heroes](/guide/hero) and [Sidekicks](/guide/sidekick) with EXP, and the player with [Rank EXP](/guide/user_rank).


## Battle Flow

<img align="center" src="/assets/img/uipage_3.png" alt="Battle Flow">

The battle timeline shows each character's order of actions. Order of action is determined by a Hero's speed (SPD). The higher their SPD stat, the sooner their chance to strike. Skills can only be selected and activated during a Hero's turn. After all characters have performed their actions, the turn is over. If desired, a Hero's turn order can be delayed to the end of turn by choosing to wait (purple icon with the hourglass).

### Battle Auto Mode

By tapping on the Auto button located at the top right of the battle screen, auto battle mode will commence.

### Battle Menu Button

By tapping on the Menu button located at the bottom right of the battle screen, the player can choose to give up on the current battle.

### Battle List Button

By tapping on the List button located at the bottom right of the battle screen, the player can view the skills of their heroes by their order of actions. This includes the skill descriptions as well as their View Power cost.

### View Power

At the bottom of the battle screen is a number that represents the Heroes' current View Power. This power granted by viewers is required to activate certain skills. Whenever the character execute an action, the character's View Power increases. Some skills have an effect on gaining View Powers, e.g. [Polaris Mask's](/charas/polaris_mask/) Mic Performance.

### Status Modifiers

During the battle, the character can be affected by several statuses. The number of actions left in a status could decrease under various conditions, such as number of actions, or they may last until the end of the turn. In the case of defensive buffs, actions are called attacks. When action counter reaches 0, the status is removed.

Statuses that grant positive effects on the hero are displayed as a yellow icon, also known as "Buffs". Conversely, statuses that afflict the hero with negative effects are displayed as a red icon, also known as "Debuffs". <!-- image missing --!>

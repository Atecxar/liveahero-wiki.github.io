## Team Organization

You can pair up both heroes and sidekicks in the menu.
Heroes who are higher up on the order list will be more likely to be targeted by enemies.

Based on [empirical observation on 999 turns](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQHqoFqCyhqUsv0JDvpPi0ASq0eWTNs7RpGPK5mYob2q2T6X1fiNbuz94XJm9sDhTIHobzFBRsau8G9/pubhtml),
the probability of the first, second, third and fourth hero being
targeted by enemies seems to be around 35%, 30%, 20% and 15% respectively.

## Number of Team Edits

Up to 7 teams can be formed at a time.

## Support Positioning

You could change the order of the support unit during battle by dragging on the banner with the label "Support" on it.

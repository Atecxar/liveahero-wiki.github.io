### Blooming (開花)

A new enhancement system, after reaching level 60 on any hero, you can further "Bloom" the hero using the rank up function

The system is as follows:
- Blooming gives one more passive slot and an additional (shiny) sprite prop
- Requires 25 {%include item.html id=135%} and 5 {%include item.html id=166%} on top of the usual rank up gem
- You can get {%include item.html id=166%} monthly from lah store
- As of now you can only get {%include item.html id=135%} from event exchange store

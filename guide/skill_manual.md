As of version 2.1.3, a new option has been added at the very bottom of training menu (lightbulb icon) which is equipment skills acquisition.

This menu can be used to give your heroes a new equipment skills from the corresponding skill manual.

The skill manual will be consumed after the hero learn the skills.

This new equipment skills use the same slot and equipped in the same way as the usual passive skills from sidekick.

As of now there is only two kinds of skill manuals available from the event shop (Space Taxi Chaser event) which is:

- {% include item-icon.html id=65 %} Second attack skill manual 
  - Grants the hero a passive skill "Second Attack"
  - In auto battle, the hero with Second Attack skill equipped will prioritize using their second skill

- {% include item-icon.html id=66 %} Third attack skill manual
  - Grants the hero a passive skill "Third Attack"
  - In auto battle, the hero with Third Attack skill equipped will prioritize using their third skill

> Without these equipment skill heroes in auto battle will always use the first skill.

## Event Preview

This happened a little before you met Melide and her friends.

Sand!  Sunshine! And the spreading blue sea!
A cruise on a sightseeing spaceship to a resort of uninhabited island "Resort Planet Gran Island" 
Invited to the pre-opening for the hero office, parallel flight company is excited to visit the sea planet Muirauqa IV!

On the way to the completion unveiling party with the idol who was present in the program shooting, I saw a dog janitor who is doubled over in agony ...!?

Akashi is trying to lend a hand, but something seems to be wrong with the resort...?
The island is covered with walls... It's starting to dive into the sea!?
Over it all can be heard a pirate villan's high laugh...!
Work together with a bad attitude dragon hero who happens to visit his hometown.
On an uninhabited island in the sea, separated from the outside world,
Will our heroes be able to protect the midsummer resort?

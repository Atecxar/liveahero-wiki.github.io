## Event Preview

Orient City is recovering from the damage caused by the kaibutsu. 
A joyful Christmas Day is quickly approaching... or it was supposed to. 
But, massive meteorite has been observed approaching the Earth!

Mokdai laughs that it'll be fine because meteorites are a common issue easily fended off, but...

The identity of the giant meteorite... is a kaibutsu!? 
A mission to destroy the meteorite Kaibutsu is launched, as ordinary anti-meteorite measures can't handle it.

To this end, the plan is to cooperate with a villain, a polar bear Conductor.
His performance, which is known on a galactic scale, will be necessary for this operation...?

In order to learn more about his background, you decided to visit a hero-fanboy reporter to gather information.

Will the heroes be able to defeat the giant meteorite closing in on them every second? Will a peaceful christmas come to the heroes!?

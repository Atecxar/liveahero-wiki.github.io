## Event Preview

Sand!  Sunshine! And the spreading blue sea!

Invited to the pre-opening for the hero office, parallel flight company is excited to visit the sea planet Muirauqa IV!

On the way to the completion unveiling party with the idol who was present in the program shooting, I saw a dog janitor who is doubled over in agony ...!?

Akashi is trying to lend a hand, but something seems to be wrong with the resort...?
The island is covered with walls... It's starting to dive into the sea!?
Over it all can be heard a pirate villan's high laugh...!

## About Rank 1/2 Characters

The Trainee character that can be obtained in this campaign comes as a rank 1 hero unit and a rank 1 sidekick unit.

Rank 1/2 units can participate in battle and sale just like normal characters but there are several differences when it comes to upgrading them.

### Hero's Promotion

Hero units with initial rank of 1 or 2 can only be promoted up to rank 4. Aside from regular rank up materials their promotions will also require {% include item-icon.html id=53 %} "Proof of Hero".

Additionally their 3rd skill will at first be locked and unusable in battle until they are promoted to rank 3.

### Hero's Fan Count

Hero units with initial rank of 1 or 2 can only gain fan count from their own personal Hero's Memories items. Said items will also can't be exchanged for {% include item-icon.html id=40 %} Record Cube.

Their fan count will only increase by 1 with each item used.

### Sidekick's Limit Breakthrough

Sidekick units of rank 1 or 2 can only be upgraded with their own personal Sidekick's Heart items. Said items will also can't be exchanged for {% include item-icon.html id=40 %} Record Cube.
